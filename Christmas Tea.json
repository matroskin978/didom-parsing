It is believed the ancient Romans inadvertently invented Sangria through the practice of adding wine to water to disinfect drinking water as they expanded their territory. Fruit was probably added later, as a way of masking the flavor of wine that may have soured during their long voyages of discovery.<\/p> \n \n<p>As time marched on, Sangria came to be known as the de facto beverage of Spain and Portugal. To this day, the mixture of wine and fruit is so popular the European Union set an official definition of the drink, to ensure people get what they paid for. According to EU law, Sangria is: a drink obtained from wine, aromatized with the addition of natural citrus-fruit extracts or essences, with or without the juice of such fruit and with the possible addition of spices.<\/p> \n<p>Delicious. We fell in love with Sangria over tapas in Seville en route to Egypt during one of our herb-buying missions. Naturally, once we'd secured the herbs we were looking for; we decided to incorporate them into a blend commemorating the experience. The resulting herbal tea, Sangria, blends Egyptian hibiscus blended with apple, rosehips and rich red slices of beets, for a warm, deep red, winy character. From ancient Rome to your teapot, Sangria has quite the tale to tell.<\/p> \n \n<p><a href=\"\/howtomaketea.html\">How to Make Tea<\/a><\/p> \n \n<p><b>Caffeine content:<\/b>None - Caffeine Free Herb and Fruit <\/p> \n \n<p><b>Antioxidant Content:<\/b> Low.

It also just so happens to be the best time of year for enjoying a nice hot cup of spiced tea.<\/p> \n \n<p>TheSpiced beverages and the holiday season go way back. Legend has it that the tradition got its start in Europe when a German wine vendor, looking to put a few extra pieces of silver in his pocket, tried to find a way to sell off his older stock before Christmas eve. Helping his wife prepare that evening's meal, he struck upon the idea of brewing his wine with the spices she was using in the kitchen.<\/p> \n \n<p>TheThe next morning, before heading out to market, the wine merchant grabbed his wife's largest cooking pot and a bag of spices and headed to market. Once he got to his stall, he started a roaring fire, filled the pot with wine and added the spice. Within minutes, the merchant next to him, a fishmonger, came over to ask him what the heavenly smell was emanating from his stall. The wine merchant ladled out two cups of the wine and the two men gave it a sip. Both found it delicious - soothing, spicy and warming. Within minutes the merchant had a lineup stretching down the street and to this day, mulled wine is available at every Christmas market in Europe.<\/p> \n \n<p>TheIn keeping with the old tradition, we're proud to offer this exceptional tea blend based on an old mulled spice recipe our Master Blender picked up on his travels. We've blended the spice with a high grown Ceylon tea and added some jolly Christmas confetti to help keep things merry.

The performance, which stretched well past Midnight, was called \"insipid\", \"lopsided\" and \"ponderous\" by unimpressed Russian critics. Now, well more than a century later, the ballet is so well enjoyed that for many, the Christmas season simply isn't complete without taking in a performance.<\/p> \n \n<p>The tale, which focuses on the adventures of a little girl, Clara, her brother Fritz and a magical nutcracker that comes to life, takes viewers on a magical journey starting at home in a 19th century German chateau and ending most famously in the Land of Sweets, in a far away kingdom known as Confiturembourg, ruled by the beautiful Sugar Plum fairy. At this point in the story, the children, as well as the audience, are enchanted by the kingdom's various inhabitants - Chinese Tea dancers, Russian Candy Cane dancers and Danish Marzipan Shepherdess dancers, among others.<\/p> \n<p>Now, we wouldn't be Master Tea blenders if we didn't think that list of performers sounded like a fabulous recipe for a deliciously soothing winter tea blend. So to honor Tchaikovsky's memory, we've decided to blend exactly that, a fabulous tea guaranteed to put a smile on your face even on the longest of winter's nights. Based on a luxury Rooibos, we've added the flavors of marzipan and fruit finished off with delicate snowflake candy quins and tiny silver ball candies for a dash of added theatrical flair.

For others, tea lovers in particular, \"heirloom\" naturally forms part of the term \"heirloom recipe\", and takes on a much more gastronomical meaning. So, why are we talking about heirloom recipes? Good question. The answer is that this blend, Frosty Plum Spice, was created by our Master Blender in homage to an old family recipe passed down by his Dutch ancestors. Legend has it that his grandmother, or Oma, having grown up on an orchard back in the old country, developed a recipe for spiced plum tarts as a way to use up fruit leftover from market day in the nearby village.<\/p> \n \n<p>So how does the old recipe hold up as a tea? There's only one way to find out, which is to taste it, which we've done extensively. Our verdict? Lekker! (That's \"delicious\" in Dutch.)

Camellia Sinensis family. A cup of black tea steeped in boiled water for 5 minutes will contain between 27 to 35 milligrams of caffeine. An equal sized cup of coffee will contain between 80 - 100 milligrams of caffeine. Caffeine quickly becomes soluble in very hot water. If you wish to reduce the caffeine level in this tea, briefly rinsing the tea leaves in extremely hot water will reduce the caffeine content between 25-50% with only a minor effect on taste.<\/p><p><b>Antioxidant Content:<\/b> High - polyphenols by dry weight. The longer you steep your tea the more polyphenols will be extracted. (Test results based on 5 minutes steeping time. Polyphenol percentages may fluctuate with lot, grade of tea, testing method, temperature of water and freshness of tea). More antioxidants are extracted from tea (L. Camellia Sinesis) the longer it is brewed. And the more tea is used, the greater the antioxidant benefit.<\/p><\/div>",
